    title: Express Yourself with Node; NoSQL Needed
    description: >
      In this session, participants will learn how to create a RESTful API with CRUD endpoints using the Hapi.js JavaScript framework for Node.js and the open source NoSQL database, Couchbase. We'll explore everything from key-value operations to rich querying of JSON data with SQL, yielding results that can be easily applied towards any client facing front-end application.
