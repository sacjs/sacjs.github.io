    title: Web USB
    description: >
      Imagine a world where you plug in your USB printer and a webpage opens up to the manufacturer's website, and without leaving your web browser, drivers are installed and a test page is already printing. What if you could plug in an Arduino and immediately be directed to a web app that lets you program it on the spot, all without having to set up your toolchain? This is a reality that is coming upon us sooner than we think.
