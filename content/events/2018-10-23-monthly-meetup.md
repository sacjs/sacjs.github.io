    title: Layout | CSS Grid
    description: >
      CSS was not meant to handle layouts until now. Be it backend, front end or full stack, this is a serious problem that many developers face. Without using using a framework like bootstrap we will layout some sample UI to help us understand the difference between styles, flex and grid.


      CSS has recently gotten a power-up. Donâ€™t be scared, get excited.

    title: Tink , Plug n Play, what about my way?
    description: >
      Both yarn and npm in a feat of simultaneous invention have brought us new patterns to store and resolve your dependencies without node_modules.


      I'm going to talk about trade offs, interesting implementation details, and considerations for making your own install-less dependency installer for node.


      Maybe we'll use a custom loader to reduce startup time for a node application!
